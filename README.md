The Transaction App is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their transactions. The app displays a main transactions list page that shows all of the user's transactions and allows them to add, delete, edit transactions, and to sort by any column and to group by the category column.

Clicking on the sort by category button adds a query parameter ?sortBy=category and returns to the same page except the category column is sorted alphabetically. Similarly, clicking on the other three sort by buttons sorts the respective columns.

Hitting the "group by category" link sends the user to a page with a simple table with two columns: one for the category and the other for the sum of the amounts for transactions in that category.
